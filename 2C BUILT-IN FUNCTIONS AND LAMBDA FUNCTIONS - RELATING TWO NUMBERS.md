---

### AIM  
Write a python program to convert the given decimal number into octal number using oct() function.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Take input** from the user as a decimal number.
3. **Convert** the input string to an integer using `int()`.
4. **Use** the built-in `oct()` function to convert the decimal number to an octal string.
5. **Display** the octal number to the user.
6. **End** the program.

### PROGRAM

```
a=int(input())
b=oct(a)
print(b)
```
