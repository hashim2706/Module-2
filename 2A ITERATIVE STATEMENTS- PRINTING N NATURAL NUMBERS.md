## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS FROM M TO N.

###  Aim
Python Program to print numbers  range from M to N (including M and N values).

---

###  Algorithm

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Input** two integers from the user: `M` (start of the range) and `N` (end of the range).
3. **Check** if `M` is less than or equal to `N`:
   - If `True`: Loop from `M` to `N` (inclusive) using a `for` loop and print each number.
   - If `False`: Loop from `M` to `N` (inclusive) in reverse using a `for` loop with negative step and print each number.
4. **End** the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
m=int(input())
n=int(input())
for i in range(m,n+1):
    print(i)


```
