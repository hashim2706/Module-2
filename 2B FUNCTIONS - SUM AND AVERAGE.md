## FUNCTIONS - SUM AND AVERAGE

### AIM  
Write a python program to define a function that accepts 3 values and return its average  

---

### ALGORITHM

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Define** a function `calculate_average(a, b, c)` that:
   - Adds the three numbers.
   - Divides the sum by 3 to get the average.
   - Returns the result.
3. **Take input** of three numbers from the user.
4. **Convert** the inputs to `float` for decimal accuracy.
5. **Call** the function with the input values.
6. **Print** the result returned by the function.
7. **End** the program.


---

### PROGRAM
```
def result(a,b,c):
    return (a+b+c)/3

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=result(a,b,c)
print("average is",d)


```
